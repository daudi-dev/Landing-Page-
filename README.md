# Landing-Page-
this is a landing page written using html, and CSS.
I will use CSS flexbox too.
Here we go! 

# Create HTML Body 1st 
Make the entire html body of the landing page.
Write the header first, then the mid section and finally the footer.
Use unordered list and ordered list to make the navbar section and the random info box section.
Added the two sign up buttons as well 
# Use CSS to style our Landing page
